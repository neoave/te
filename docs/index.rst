`te` introduction
======================

`te` is a general multi-host workload execution utility.

It's intentionally lightweight, utilizing existing technology like Ansible for
execution and Mrack for provisioning.

Primary use cases are:

* repeatable test execution which combines provisioning of vms/containers and
  test execution
* preparation of vms for labs/workshops
* preparation of development environment
